# Pollinate 

This project is mostly a learning ground for me to understand Titanium.
Since I'd rather poke my eyeballs with hot pokers than live in Eclipse,
I've chosen to use Vim and work with Titanium from the command line.

Pollinate is built with CoffeeScript, Sass, and Titanium, courtesy of [Ti](https://github.com/revans/Ti), the rapid development framework.
